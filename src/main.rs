//TODO list
//decide which attacks can cancel into which 
//how to handle light kick pivot weirdness (her left feet should stay in the same place)
//add input buffer

//mash attacks like E.Honda palm strikes 
//add hitstun in hurt animation
//if there is a trade make the hitstun work during attack animation
//make dash have movement only during some frames and not during others + lock in position
//apply attacks struct values (knockback, hitstun, etc)
//add movement to each attack
//(e.g: if you jump and kick on the right side of the opponent, he should be pushed to the right)
//make an enum for with startup|active|recovery and use code to detect a hitbox and switch to active, and switch back to recovery Â´
//this is important to be able to cancel the recovery of attacks
//calculate frame advantage on the fly
//display different vfx colors and sizes depending on the frame advantage //change color of vfx using sdl2 texture tint OR shader, which one?

//hit stun should only freeze two characters not everything else
//define a ground height and a offset for each character to be at the correct ground height
//add hit combos and block combos, these should be displayed while they are happening and not at the end to give faster feedback
//charge special attacks
//check how to pitch shift attacks sound chunks depending on frame advantage
//dash attacks
//projectile with a specific target location
//specific projectile only live if keep holding button
//VFX sprites are not centered, hard to place
//fix init colliders, its a mess

//add menu to change the controllers for each player
//add menu to change the controller mapping of keys/buttons
//refactor menu and maybe remove menu having a separate loop?
//rollback should not happen during enemy stunned/hitstun if there is no way to escape
//same during uncancellable animations
//should it still re-simulate? probably not, but need to handle inputs if we buffer inputs during hitstun
//lobby system -> needs server
//instant rematch (avoid going back to lobby or going back to selection)
//show ping and show wifi/ethernet
//make ui loop only 60fps to avoid the computer doing too many wasted computations
//check if game is deterministic <- THIS IS VITAL FOR ROLLBACK MULTIPLAYER
